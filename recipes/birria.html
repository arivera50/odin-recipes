    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Birria is a traditional Mexican stew that originated in the state of Jalisco, 
       though it’s now enjoyed across the country and beyond. Typically made with goat meat,
       it can also be prepared with beef or lamb, marinated in a rich blend of dried chiles,
       spices, garlic, and vinegar. The meat is slow-cooked until tender, resulting in a 
       flavorful, spicy, and aromatic dish.</p>
    <p>Traditionally served in a bowl with its broth (called consomé), birria is often 
       accompanied by chopped onions, cilantro, lime, and tortillas. In recent years, 
       it has gained popularity in the form of birria tacos, where the meat is folded 
       into tortillas, pan-fried with cheese, and dipped in the savory broth. This 
       comforting dish is a staple at celebrations and has become a symbol of regional 
       Mexican cuisine.</p>
