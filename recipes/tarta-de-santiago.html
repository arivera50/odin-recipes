       <h3>Description</h3>
      
       <p>Tarta de Santiago is a traditional almond cake from Galicia, Spain, linked to the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage. Made with ground almonds,
        eggs, and sugar, it has a moist texture and a rich, nutty flavor. Naturally gluten-free, itâ€™s often flavored with lemon zest, cinnamon, or a touch of liqueur.</p>
       
       <p>Its signature look comes from a powdered sugar topping with the cross of Saint James stenciled in the center. Served as a dessert or with coffee, the cake 
        is a proud symbol of Galician culture and a favorite among pilgrims and locals alike.</p>
