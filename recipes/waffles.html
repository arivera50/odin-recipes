     <h3>Description</h3>
     <p>Waffles are a popular breakfast treat made from a batter of flour, eggs, sugar, and milk, cooked in a special waffle iron
         that gives them their signature grid pattern. They have a crisp, golden exterior with a soft, airy interior, and their versatility 
         allows for various flavorings, from vanilla to cinnamon or chocolate. Depending on the recipe, waffles can be light and airy or 
         thick and dense, making them a perfect canvas for different toppings.</p>
     <p>Traditionally, waffles are served warm, topped with butter, syrup, fresh fruit, whipped cream, or even ice cream for a dessert 
        version. They are commonly enjoyed for breakfast, but their versatility extends to savory options, with toppings like fried chicken or bacon.
         Whether enjoyed as a comforting morning meal or an indulgent snack, waffles remain a beloved dish worldwide.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2¼ cups all-purpose flour (270g)</li>
        <li>¼ cup granulated sugar (50g)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups milk (480ml)</li>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter melted (113g)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the waffle iron. (If you can choose settings, I recommend a darker or higher heat setting for a crispier waffle.)</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. In a medium bowl, whisk together the milk,
             melted butter, eggs, and vanilla. Pour the milk mixture into the flour mixture and stir together just until combined.</li>
        <li>Grease the hot waffle iron with butter or cooking spray. Add about 1/3 cup of batter for each waffle to the hot waffle 
            iron. (The amount will depend on the size of your waffle maker so feel free to experiment with how much you add.)</li>
        <li>Cook until golden brown. Place on a wire rack until ready to serve so they stay crisp. Serve hot with maple syrup and
             butter or your favorite toppings.</li>
    </ol>
