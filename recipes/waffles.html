     <h2>Description</h2>
     <p>Waffles are a popular breakfast treat made from a batter of flour, eggs, sugar, and milk, cooked in a special waffle iron
         that gives them their signature grid pattern. They have a crisp, golden exterior with a soft, airy interior, and their versatility 
         allows for various flavorings, from vanilla to cinnamon or chocolate. Depending on the recipe, waffles can be light and airy or 
         thick and dense, making them a perfect canvas for different toppings.</p>
     <p>Traditionally, waffles are served warm, topped with butter, syrup, fresh fruit, whipped cream, or even ice cream for a dessert 
        version. They are commonly enjoyed for breakfast, but their versatility extends to savory options, with toppings like fried chicken or bacon.
         Whether enjoyed as a comforting morning meal or an indulgent snack, waffles remain a beloved dish worldwide.</p>
